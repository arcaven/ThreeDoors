## Technique Sessions

### Six Thinking Hats - 60 minutes

**Description:** Explored the todo app concept from six different mental perspectives to uncover comprehensive insights about user needs and opportunities.

#### Ideas Generated:

**🤍 White Hat - Facts:**
1. Users get overwhelmed with work, lose track of priorities
2. Avoidance behavior - working on easier tasks to dodge intimidating/unclear ones
3. "Shift left" principle - proactive intervention before problems occur
4. Action precedes motivation ("smile precedes happiness")
5. Breaking down intimidating tasks is a core need
6. Challenge: balancing focus (critical path) vs. scope creep (side quests)
7. Goal: steady velocity without decision fatigue, not perfection

**💛 Yellow Hat - Optimism:**
8. Could reduce anxiety around task management
9. Reinvigorate passion for pursuits (work, hobbies, interests, life)
10. Increase fulfillment and satisfaction
11. Unlock greater human potential
12. Reduce friction for getting started on goals
13. Enable creative, financial, and personal success
14. Help people achieve their best selves

**🖤 Black Hat - Critical:**
15. Users have scattered, partially completed lists everywhere
16. Lists are hard to organize, link, and maintain
17. Lists become procrastination/delaying tactics themselves
18. List size itself becomes intimidating
19. Dependency loops lead to valley of despair → quitting before starting
20. ADHD triggers: tangents, yak shaving within seconds of list creation
21. List-making drains creative/productive energy
22. Collapse from creative thinking into mechanical task reproduction
23. Lose big picture in minutiae very quickly
24. **Core problem: Todo lists often make the problem worse, not better**

**❤️ Red Hat - Emotions:**
25. Anxiety no matter what: short list=incomplete, long list=impossible, healthy list=paralyzed
26. Uncertainty about where to start, what matters most
27. Confusion about what's actionable now vs. needs replanning
28. Self-doubt: "Am I avoiding real work by making this list?"
29. Fear of wasting time/money/effort on meaningless things
30. Dread of investing in something that makes you miserable
31. **The emotional paradox: Lists promise control but deliver anxiety**

**💚 Green Hat - Creativity:**
32. Work WITH human psychology - react to and shape creative/productive energy
33. Coax users toward flow state and task-positive energy
34. Account for: fatigue, anxiety, subject fatigue
35. Dance around challenges, doubt, obstacles
36. Re-energize OR rest the user (knowing when to do which!)
37. Leverage dopamine and reward systems ethically
38. Help users understand and take charge of their lives
39. Balance long-term goals with immediate rewards
40. Trading system: offer simple/easy micro-tasks that progress important work → unlock rewards
41. Gamification: turn task execution into actual gameplay
42. Progress visualization: show past achievements
43. Fandom-based rewards: badges, leaderboards with "competitors" from favorite fandoms
44. Question-based breakdown: ask questions to help decompose goals
45. Future projection: project into future where goal is achieved to get unstuck
46. Creative unblocking: help find novel ways to unblock stuck tasks
47. Dependency chain collapse: eliminate or shortcut entire dependency chains
48. User autonomy: NOT a meat puppet, NOT another boss/nag
49. Adaptive partnership: match user energy OR counter negative emotions
50. Cycle interruption: break negative patterns

#### Insights Discovered:
- Todo apps should use engagement psychology for user benefit, not corporate manipulation
- The app lives at the intersection of intention and action - uniquely positioned to unlock human potential
- Core principle: Ethical engagement engineering for human flourishing
- Tasks have hidden emotional/mental weight beyond their objective complexity

#### Notable Connections:
- "Shift left" concept appears in both problem identification and solution design
- Action preceding thought connects to "progress over perfection" philosophy
- Emotional barriers and creative solutions mirror each other

### Five Whys - 30 minutes

**Description:** Deep exploration of root motivations and fundamental truths behind the vision through iterative "why" questioning.

#### Ideas Generated:

**Why #1 - Why work with human psychology?**
1. Humans are not machines or pure reason
2. Exist in biological, social, physical reality with minute-by-minute changing conditions
3. Reality spectrum: Michelangelo with flu ↔ cousin Jack on best day ↔ grieving coworker (everyday, not edge cases)
4. Technology's purpose: use environment to achieve goals easier/better/faster
5. Current todo apps are just more work (ironically)

**Why #2 - Why does understanding true purpose matter?**
6. Each person has limited time to achieve what's important
7. Life is not a race, game, or labor camp
8. Overcome drag, resistance, negative influences that blunt personal light
9. Enable contributions to environment, families, community, society
10. **Helping someone live a better life = worthy of humanity's greatest achievements**
11. No higher achievement than improving human potential

**Why #3 - What creates the drag?**
12. Depression, valley of despair
13. Inertia, brain chemistry
14. Distractions, low self-esteem
15. Uncertainty/lack of clarity about what matters
16. Can't keep goals in sight
17. Stress/challenge too great to even think about goal
18. Hidden knowledge gap: don't know how easy a task might be
19. Hidden knowledge gap: don't know how to use psychology for low-friction progress
20. Not finding/igniting passion

**Why #4 - Why can/should a todo app address these?**
21. Todo app sits at the action layer
22. It's the personal assistant, coach, and partner
23. Uniquely positioned - more than any other application type
24. Lives at intersection of intention and action - where potential flourishes or dies

**Why #5 - Why does this matter to YOU personally?**
25. Started as simple BMAD demo, became real through brainstorming
26. Recognized own needs that would bring rich, rewarding benefits
27. Real needs → better learning (vs empty "hello world")
28. Learning BMAD effectively might be difference between job stability and decline
29. Even if app fails → learn BMAD → coach colleagues → protect career/finances/health
30. **Having genuine skin in the game transforms academic exercise into real innovation**

#### Insights Discovered:
- This isn't about productivity - it's about actualizing human potential
- People are blocked by what they don't know they don't know
- The brainstorming process itself revealed genuine personal needs
- Building for yourself first creates authentic learning and better outcomes

#### Notable Connections:
- Personal stakes revealed why "progress over perfection" resonates so deeply
- The facilitator's own journey mirrors the user journey the app should enable

*Key realizations from the session*

- **Progress over perfection is the north star**: Help user do something to improve - what they work on, what they track, or alignment with values/goals - in ANY way, right now, better than yesterday

- **Build for yourself first**: If it helps you → you improve it → you achieve more. This creates authentic design and better learning outcomes than theoretical requirements

- **The brainstorming process works**: Started with "simple BMAD demo" and discovered genuine personal needs through exploration. Real stakes transform academic exercises into innovation

- **Todo lists are part of the problem**: Traditional apps increase anxiety, enable procrastination, drain energy. This app must be fundamentally different

- **Ethical engagement engineering**: Use psychology and gamification FOR the user's benefit, not corporate manipulation. This is the moral foundation

- **Shift left everywhere**: Proactive intervention before problems occur - in task breakdown, emotional support, assumption challenging, replanning

- **Action precedes thought**: Starting brings light and understanding. The app should reduce barriers to beginning, not perfect planning

- **Humans exist in states, not static conditions**: Minute-by-minute changes in energy, emotion, capacity. App must adapt to human reality

- **Intersection of intention and action**: Todo apps are uniquely positioned to unlock human potential because they live where decisions become reality

- **Three archetypes, one truth**: Alex (ADHD), Jordan (overwhelmed), Sam (depressed) need different things but share need for reduced friction and emotional intelligence

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Core Philosophy - "Progress Over Perfection"

**Rationale:** This is the defining principle that makes this app different from all others. It addresses the root cause of todo app failure: they demand perfection and create anxiety. This philosophy permeates every design decision.

**Next steps:**
1. Define what "better than yesterday" means across dimensions (what you work on, what you track, alignment with values)
2. Design interaction patterns that encourage starting imperfectly
3. Create messaging/copy that reinforces progress mindset
4. Build "yesterday comparison" feature to make improvement visible
5. Implement "one improvement prompt per session"

**Resources needed:**
- UX design time to craft interaction patterns
- Thoughtful copywriting for encouragement
- Simple state persistence (Go file storage)
- Delta calculation logic

**Timeline:** Week 1-2 of MVP development

---

#### #2 Priority: MVP Feature Set - Dead Simple Starting Point

**Rationale:** Demonstrate BMAD method with working software that solves a real problem. Keep scope tight, build for personal use first, prove the concept works.

**Next steps:**
1. Implement dead simple task capture (local storage - JSON file or Apple Notes)
2. Build choose-your-own-adventure interaction model
3. Add values/goals always-visible display
4. Implement yesterday comparison
5. Add one improvement prompt per session
6. Write excellent README documenting BMAD process and learnings

**Resources needed:**
- Go development environment
- Cross-platform build setup (make or task)
- gofumpt for code formatting
- Basic CLI or TUI framework (consider bubbletea, cobra, or simple stdin/stdout)

**Timeline:** Weeks 1-3 of MVP development

---

#### #3 Priority: BMAD Demonstration Quality

**Rationale:** Primary purpose is demonstrating BMAD method. Code quality, documentation, and process matter as much as features. This is a teaching tool.

**Next steps:**
1. Set up project with idiomatic Go structure
2. Implement good design patterns (appropriate for simple app)
3. Follow Go coding standards consistently
4. Run gofumpt frequently
5. Write comprehensive README (purpose, setup, usage, BMAD learnings)
6. Document architecture decisions and trade-offs
7. Set up make/task build system
8. Ensure Mac/Linux/Windows compatibility
9. Prepare for GitHub hosting with good repo hygiene

**Resources needed:**
- Go best practices research
- BMAD documentation review
- Time for thoughtful documentation writing
- Cross-platform testing capability

**Timeline:** Ongoing throughout development, with documentation polish in final week

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- Six Thinking Hats revealed comprehensive view of problem and opportunity space
- Five Whys uncovered personal stakes and authentic motivation
- Role Playing (Alex, Jordan, Sam) grounded abstract ideas in real user needs
- Open-ended exploration allowed breakthrough insights to emerge naturally
- Honest acknowledgment of personal connection to Sam persona
- Scoping discipline emerged organically ("build for yourself first")

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Technical architecture:** What Go frameworks/libraries best support the interaction model? (TUI vs CLI vs hybrid)
- **LLM integration patterns:** How to integrate AI assumption challenging without adding complexity to MVP?
- **Multi-source data modeling:** How to design data structures that can eventually integrate diverse sources?
- **Gamification ethics:** What's the line between helpful engagement and manipulative addiction mechanics?
- **Flow state triggers:** What are evidence-based techniques for helping users enter flow?
- **Cross-platform UX:** How to maintain consistent experience across Mac/Linux/Windows?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **SCAMPER Method:** Apply to MVP feature set - what can we Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse?
- **Assumption Reversal:** Challenge "todo apps must have lists" and other core assumptions
- **Morphological Analysis:** Systematically explore combinations of interaction modes, storage types, gamification elements
- **First Principles Thinking:** Break down "task management" to fundamentals and rebuild from scratch
- **Metaphor Mapping:** Explore "personal coach," "adventure game," "GPS for life" metaphors more deeply

### Questions That Emerged
- How do we measure "better than yesterday" across different improvement dimensions?
- What's the minimum viable gamification that feels rewarding without being gimmicky?
- How can choose-your-own-adventure navigation work in a simple CLI/TUI?
- What does "values always visible" look like in a terminal interface?
- How do we handle the tension between simplicity (BMAD demo) and sophistication (real needs)?
- Can we prototype LLM assumption challenging without full API integration?
- What's the right balance between guidance and autonomy for different user states?
- How do we avoid becoming "another boss" or "nagging voice"?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  - Technical architecture deep dive (Go frameworks, data modeling, cross-platform considerations)
  - UX design workshop (specific interaction flows, messaging/copy, visual design in terminal)
  - Gamification ethics and mechanics (what to build, what to avoid)
  - Testing strategy for emotional/psychological features

- **Recommended timeframe:** After MVP v0.1 is working (2-3 weeks), reconvene to evaluate what's working and plan next iteration

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Build and use MVP for at least 1 week
  - Document what works, what doesn't, what's missing
  - Capture user experience notes (your own usage)
  - Research Go TUI frameworks and interaction patterns
  - Explore LLM API options and costs

## Product Vision Statement

**For people who struggle with traditional todo apps** (which create anxiety rather than alleviating it), **this is a personal achievement partner** that works with human psychology instead of against it. **Unlike conventional task managers** that demand perfect planning and complete information upfront, **this app helps you make any improvement - in what you work on, what you track, or how you align actions with values - right now, better than yesterday.** It embodies the principle that progress over perfection, imperfect action over perfect planning, and starting brings the light that reveals the path forward.
