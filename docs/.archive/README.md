## Current Documentation Structure

As of November 11, 2025, the project uses a **sharded documentation approach**:

- **PRD:** `docs/prd/` directory with modular sections (index.md, epic-details.md, requirements.md, etc.)
- **Architecture:** `docs/architecture/` directory with modular sections (introduction.md, components.md, core-workflows.md, etc.)
- **Configuration:** `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` specifies sharded locations

The sharded approach improves maintainability, enables focused updates, and aligns with BMAD methodology practices.
