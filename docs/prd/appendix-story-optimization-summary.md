# Appendix: Story Optimization Summary

## Changes Made in Version 1.2

**Sequence Optimization:**
- **Moved Story 1.6 (Refresh) → Story 1.4**: Validates refresh UX before completion implementation
  - **Original Flow:** Display → Select/Complete → Refresh
  - **Optimized Flow:** Display → Refresh → Select/Complete
  - **Rationale:** User wants to refresh *until finding a task they like*, then complete it. Testing refresh after completion is backwards.

**Story Simplifications:**
- **Story 1.2 (File I/O):** Removed sample task generation, comment parsing, complex empty line handling
  - **Time Saved:** ~10 minutes
  - **Rationale:** User will populate real tasks; simple parsing sufficient for validation

- **Story 1.5 (Completion):** Merged with persistence tracking; made file persistence optional
  - **Time Saved:** ~5 minutes (if skipping persistence)
  - **Rationale:** In-memory completion sufficient for UX validation; file persistence is nice-to-have

- **Story 1.6 (Polish):** Removed README, extensive edge cases, celebration messages
  - **Time Saved:** ~20 minutes
  - **Rationale:** Solo user doesn't need README; edge cases unlikely in 1-week validation

**Total Time Reduction:** 4-8 hours → 3-6 hours (25-37% faster) while maintaining validation quality

**Story Count:** 7 → 6 stories

**Validation Quality Maintained:**
- ✅ Three Doors visual display
- ✅ Refresh mechanism
- ✅ Task selection and completion
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ "Progress over perfection" messaging
- ✅ Essential polish and styling

**Deferred to MVP (if Tech Demo succeeds):**
- Sample task auto-generation
- Comment support in tasks.txt
- README documentation
- Extensive edge case handling
- All tasks completed celebration
- Persistent completed.txt (optional in Tech Demo)
