# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right (pivoted to Technical Demo & Validation approach)

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready

**Most Critical Observations:**
- Excellent pivot to Technical Demo validates concept before major investment
- Clear phased approach with decision gate prevents premature optimization
- Technical assumptions well-researched (Go 1.25.4, Apple Notes options, Context7 MCP)
- Story breakdown appropriately sized for 4-8 hour timeline
- Minor gaps don't block progress

## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None

**HIGH:** None

**MEDIUM:**
1. **Task data model**: While simple (line of text), could explicitly document what constitutes a task (format, max length, special characters handling)
2. **Post-validation decision criteria**: "Feels better than a list" is subjective; could add specific measurement approaches (e.g., count refreshes per session, time to select task, subjective 1-10 rating)

**LOW:**
1. **Visual mockups**: Three Doors described in text but no ASCII mockup; helpful but not blocking
2. **Error message catalog**: Could pre-define friendly error messages for common scenarios

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness: EXCELLENT**

**Strengths:**
- Technical Demo approach validates core hypothesis before investing in complexity
- 4-8 hour timeline is achievable and realistic
- Text file storage removes Apple Notes integration risk from critical path
- Clear success criteria (daily use for 1 week)
- Decision gate prevents continuing down wrong path

**Potential Cuts (if needed):**
- Story 1.7 (Polish & Styling) could be reduced if time-constrained; core UX works without perfect styling

**Missing Features (none essential for Tech Demo):**
- All deferred features appropriately moved to post-validation phases

**Complexity Concerns:**
- Bubbletea learning curve is only complexity; mitigated by simple requirements

**Timeline Realism:**
- **Optimized:** 3-6 hours for 6 stories (down from 4-8 hours for 7 stories)
- Story time estimates: 30-45m + 20-30m + 45-60m + 15-20m + 45-75m + 20-30m = 175-260 minutes (2.9-4.3 hours)
- With buffer for learning Bubbletea and debugging: 3-6 hours total
- Very realistic given simplicity of text file I/O and clear acceptance criteria
- Time savings from removing sample task generation, comment parsing, extensive edge cases, README

## Technical Readiness

**Technical Constraints: CLEAR**

**Specified Constraints:**
- Go 1.25.4+
- Bubbletea + Lipgloss
- macOS primary platform
- Text files in `~/.threedoors/`
- No external dependencies for Tech Demo

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- **LOW**: Bubbletea learning curve (mitigated: good documentation, simple use case)
- **DEFERRED**: Apple Notes integration (appropriate - not needed for Tech Demo)

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**
- None for Tech Demo phase
- Apple Notes integration options documented for future investigation (4 approaches identified with Context7 MCP)

**Architecture Guidance Quality:**
- Architecture section provides clear direction
- "No abstractions yet" guidance prevents over-engineering
- Post-validation architecture evolution path documented

---

## Recommendations

**For Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Proceed to Development** - PRD is ready for Story 1.1 implementation
   - All blockers resolved
   - Technical stack clear
   - Acceptance criteria testable

2. **Consider Adding (Optional - Not Blocking):**
   - Quick ASCII mockup of Three Doors layout (5 min exercise, helps visualize before coding)
   - Explicit task data model: `Task = string (max 200 chars, UTF-8)` just for completeness
   - Decision criteria template for post-validation: "Rate 1-10: Did Three Doors reduce friction? Would you continue using?"

3. **Track During Development:**
   - Actual time per story (validate 4-8 hour estimate)
   - Bubbletea learning curve challenges (inform future estimates)
   - User experience insights during validation week (feed into Epic 2+ planning)

**For Post-Validation (If Epic 1 Succeeds):**

4. **Before Epic 2:**
   - Run Apple Notes integration spike (evaluate 4 identified options)
   - Define explicit success criteria from Epic 1 learnings

5. **Documentation:**
   - Capture Epic 1 retrospective learnings
   - Update PRD with actual Technical Demo results before proceeding to Epic 2

## Strengths Worth Highlighting

1. **Pragmatic Scope Management**: Pivot to Technical Demo demonstrates excellent product thinking - validate before investing
2. **Research Quality**: Technical assumptions informed by current, accurate information (Go 1.25.4, Apple Notes options via Context7 MCP)
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Text file approach removes highest risk (Apple Notes) from critical path
4. **Clear Decision Gates**: Explicit decision point after validation prevents sunk cost fallacy
5. **Story Quality**: Acceptance criteria are specific, testable, and sized appropriately
6. **BMAD Alignment**: Process demonstrates "progress over perfection" philosophy the product espouses

---

## Final Decision

**✅ READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for immediate implementation of Epic 1. The Technical Demo & Validation approach mitigates risk excellently while maintaining the vision for future expansion.

**Recommended Next Action:** Begin Story 1.1 (Project Setup & Basic Bubbletea App)
