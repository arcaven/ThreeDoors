# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

**Technical Demo & Validation Phase (Pre-MVP):**
- Validate the Three Doors UX concept in 1 week (4-8 hours of development)
- Prove the core hypothesis: "Presenting three diverse tasks is better than presenting a list"
- Build working TUI with Bubbletea to demonstrate feasibility
- Use simple local text file for rapid task population and testing
- Gather real usage feedback before investing in complex integrations

**Full MVP Goals (Post-Validation):**
- Master BMAD methodology through authentic, real-world application
- Create a todo app that reduces friction and actually helps with organization
- Build a personal achievement partner that works with human psychology, not against it
- Enable seamless cross-context navigation across multiple platforms and tools
- Capture the full story (what AND why) to improve stakeholder communication
- Achieve measurably better personal organization than current scattered approach
- Demonstrate progress-over-perfection philosophy in both product design and development process

## Background Context

Traditional todo apps work well for already-organized people, but they're fundamentally rudimentary tools that haven't evolved alongside modern technology capabilities. While they help those who are naturally organized stay organized, they offer little support for adapting to the dynamic reality of modern life—where the same person occupies multiple roles (employee, parent, partner, learner), experiences varying moods and energy states, and faces constantly shifting priorities.

ThreeDoors recognizes that as technology has advanced, we can offer substantially more support. We can organize our organization tools themselves, bringing together tasks scattered across multiple systems. More importantly, we can adapt technology support dynamically: responding to the user's current context, role, mood, and circumstances, re-routing based on changing conditions and priorities. This PRD defines the MVP: a CLI/TUI application with Apple Notes integration that begins this journey, embodying "progress over perfection" philosophy while serving as a practical demonstration of the BMAD methodology.

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-11-07 | 1.0 | Initial PRD creation from project brief | John (PM Agent) |
| 2025-11-07 | 1.1 | Pivoted to Technical Demo & Validation approach (Option C): Simplified to text file storage, 1-week validation timeline, deferred Apple Notes and learning features to post-validation phases | John (PM Agent) |
| 2025-11-07 | 1.2 | Optimized Epic 1 story sequence (Option A): Moved refresh before completion (1.6→1.4), merged completion with persistence, simplified file I/O and polish stories. Reduced timeline from 4-8 hours to 3-6 hours while maintaining validation quality | John (PM Agent) |
