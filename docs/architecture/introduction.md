# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **ThreeDoors**, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
Since ThreeDoors is a CLI/TUI application with no separate web/mobile frontend, this document serves as the complete architectural specification. The TUI layer (using Bubbletea) is treated as part of the presentation layer within this architecture.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision: No Starter Template**

After reviewing the PRD, this is a **greenfield project** with the following characteristics:

- **Language & Framework:** Go 1.25.4+ with Bubbletea/Charm Bracelet ecosystem
- **Project Type:** CLI/TUI application (not a web framework starter)
- **Approach:** Built from scratch using `go mod init`

**Rationale:**
- Go CLI applications don't typically use starter templates beyond `go mod init`
- Bubbletea provides the TUI framework but doesn't impose project structure
- The PRD specifies a simple, custom structure appropriate for the Technical Demo phase
- Building from scratch aligns with the "no abstractions yet" principle for rapid validation

**Project Structure (from PRD):**
