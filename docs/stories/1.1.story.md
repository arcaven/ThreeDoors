# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic Bubbletea App

**As a** developer,
**I want** a working Go project with Bubbletea framework,
**so that** I have a foundation for building the Three Doors TUI.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Go module initialized with `go mod init github.com/arcaven/ThreeDoors`
2. Bubbletea and Lipgloss dependencies added
3. Basic TUI application renders "ThreeDoors - Technical Demo" header
4. Application responds to 'q' keypress to quit
5. `Makefile` with `build`, `run`, and `clean` targets works
6. Application compiles and runs without errors

## Dev Notes

This story establishes the foundational structure of the application. All code should adhere to the project's defined standards.

### Architecture & Project Structure

*   **Architectural Style**: Simple Monolithic CLI Application. [Source: `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md`]
*   **TUI Framework**: Bubbletea with the Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern is mandatory. [Source: `docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md`]
*   **Project Layout**:
    *   `cmd/threedoors/main.go`: Application entry point.
    *   `internal/tui/`: For all Bubbletea components.
    *   `go.mod`: For dependency management.
    *   `Makefile`: For build automation.
    *   [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`]

### Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Go `1.25.4`
*   **TUI Framework**: `charmbracelet/bubbletea`
*   **TUI Styling**: `charmbracelet/lipgloss`
*   **Build System**: `make`
*   [Source: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`]

### Coding Standards

*   **Formatting**: `gofumpt` must be used.
*   **Linting**: `golangci-lint` must pass.
*   **Naming Conventions**:
    *   Packages: `lowercase`
    *   Files: `snake_case.go`
    *   Exported Types/Functions: `PascalCase`
*   **Critical Rule**: Do not use `fmt.Println` for TUI output. All rendering must go through Bubbletea `View()` methods.
*   [Source: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`]

### Testing

*   While this initial story is primarily setup, any logic introduced should be unit tested.
*   Tests will be placed in `*_test.go` files.
*   [Source: `docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md`]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **(AC: 1)** Initialize Go module: `go mod init github.com/arcaven/ThreeDoors`.
- [x] **(AC: 2)** Add dependencies using `go get`:
    *   `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea`
    *   `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss`
- [x] **(AC: 5)** Create a `Makefile` with `build`, `run`, and `clean` targets as defined in `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`.
- [x] **(AC: 3, 4)** Create the application entry point at `cmd/threedoors/main.go`.
    *   Implement a basic Bubbletea model.
    *   The `View()` method should return the string "ThreeDoors - Technical Demo".
    *   The `Update()` method should handle the `tea.KeyMsg` for 'q' and 'ctrl+c' to quit the application.
- [x] **(AC: 6)** Run `make build` and `make run` to verify the application compiles and displays the header correctly.
- [x] **(AC: 6)** Run `make clean` to verify the build artifacts are removed.
- [x] Run `gofumpt -w .` to format the code.
- [x] Run `golangci-lint run ./...` to check for any linting issues.
